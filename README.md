# Blender-JKA-Toolset

This is a compilation of all of mrwonkos Blender plugins, ported to 2.64:

    -MD3 Exporter (originally by Xembie, forked a couple of versions ago)
    -ROFF Importer & Exporter
    -ASE Importer & Exporter (specifically for GtkRadiant/Q3Map2 - very simplistic)
    -.map patch exporter - i.e. export as patches
    -GLM/GLA Importer & Exporter and animation.cfg exporter with support for everything, including creation of new playermodels and animations.

There are also new tools added and some fixes.
